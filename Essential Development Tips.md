# Essential Development Tips: CMD, PowerShell, Azure Cloud Shell, and VS Code Mastery for Programmers

You can leverage the command line interfaces (CLI) such as Command Prompt (CMD), PowerShell, and Azure Cloud Shell for various tasks related to development and deployment. Here's a brief overview of each and how you might use them:

### 1. Command Prompt (CMD):
CMD is a basic command-line interpreter on Windows. You can perform tasks like file manipulation, directory navigation, and basic scripting.

- **Navigate through directories:**
  ```bash
  cd <directory_path>
  ```

- **List files and directories:**
  ```bash
  dir
  ```

- **Run Python scripts:**
  ```bash
  python script.py
  ```

### 2. PowerShell:
PowerShell is a more powerful shell and scripting language on Windows. It integrates with the .NET framework and allows you to perform a wide range of tasks.

- **Navigate through directories:**
  ```powershell
  cd <directory_path>
  ```

- **List files and directories:**
  ```powershell
  Get-ChildItem
  ```

- **Run Python scripts:**
  ```powershell
  python script.py
  ```

### 3. Azure Cloud Shell:
Azure Cloud Shell is a cloud-based shell provided by Microsoft Azure. It allows you to manage Azure resources directly from the browser.

- **Access Azure Cloud Shell:**
  Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), and click on the Cloud Shell icon in the top menu.

- **Use Python in Azure Cloud Shell:**
  Azure Cloud Shell comes pre-configured with Python. You can run Python scripts and execute various Azure CLI commands.

- **Run Azure CLI commands:**
  ```bash
  az <command>
  ```

### Command Prompt (CMD) and PowerShell:

1. **Text Editors:**
   - Use the command line to open your favorite text editor. For example, to open Notepad in CMD:
     ```bash
     notepad
     ```
   - For PowerShell, you might use:
     ```powershell
     notepad
     ```

2. **File Manipulation:**
   - Copy files:
     ```bash
     copy file.txt destination_folder
     ```
   - Move files:
     ```powershell
     Move-Item file.txt destination_folder
     ```

3. **Environment Variables:**
   - View environment variables in CMD:
     ```bash
     set
     ```
   - View environment variables in PowerShell:
     ```powershell
     Get-ChildItem Env:
     ```

4. **Network Commands:**
   - Check network connectivity:
     ```bash
     ping google.com
     ```
   - Retrieve information about your network interfaces:
     ```powershell
     Get-NetAdapter
     ```

### Azure Cloud Shell:

1. **Azure Resource Management:**
   - List your Azure subscriptions:
     ```bash
     az account list
     ```
   - Set your active subscription:
     ```bash
     az account set --subscription <subscription_id>
     ```

2. **Azure App Service (for web development):**
   - Deploy a Python web app:
     ```bash
     az webapp up --name <app_name> --sku F1
     ```

3. **Azure Storage:**
   - Create a storage account:
     ```bash
     az storage account create --name <storage_account_name> --resource-group <resource_group> --location <region> --sku Standard_LRS
     ```

4. **Azure Functions (serverless Python functions):**
   - Create a Python function:
     ```bash
     func init MyFunctionProj --python
     ```

5. **Docker Commands:**
   - Azure Cloud Shell includes Docker, allowing you to work with containers:
     ```bash
     docker pull <image_name>
     docker run <image_name>
     ```

6. **Git Commands:**
   - Azure Cloud Shell has Git installed:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository_url>
     ```


- **Manage Azure resources:**
  Use Azure CLI commands or Azure PowerShell cmdlets to manage Azure resources.

### Additional Tips:
- Familiarize yourself with basic command-line navigation and common commands.
- Learn about version control systems like Git and use the command line for Git operations.
- Explore Azure CLI commands and PowerShell cmdlets for managing cloud resources.
- Consider automating repetitive tasks using scripts in Python or PowerShell.

#### Remember
- To refer to the documentation for each tool and platform for more in-depth information and examples. As you progress, you may discover additional features and commands that suit your development needs.

- These are just a few examples, and the actual commands you use will depend on your specific tasks and the tools you're working with. Don't hesitate to explore documentation and resources specific to the technologies you're using for more detailed information.
